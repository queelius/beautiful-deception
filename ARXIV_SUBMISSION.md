## Abstract for arXiv Submission

How do you store infinity in 256 bits? This paper explores the fundamental deception at the heart of computational cryptography: using finite information to simulate infinite randomness. We prove why true random oracles are impossible, then show how lazy evaluation creates a beautiful lie—a finite automaton that successfully pretends to be infinite. We reveal that "randomness" in cryptography is actually computational hardness in disguise, demonstrating through Python implementations how 256 bits of entropy can generate sequences indistinguishable from infinite randomness to any computationally bounded observer.

The paper bridges theory and practice by providing working Python implementations that demonstrate key concepts. We explore connections to uncomputable real numbers, showing that random oracles are the cryptographic analog of uncomputable reals. From a constructivist perspective, we argue that our "deception" might be more honest than classical mathematics—we openly work with finite programs that generate unbounded output rather than pretending infinite objects exist.

Our implementations include several LazyDigest variants (hierarchical, rekeying, sponge, XOR multi-hash) that extend the basic construction with different security properties. We also explore philosophical implications, connecting computational boundedness to entropy, time's arrow, and the nature of randomness itself.
